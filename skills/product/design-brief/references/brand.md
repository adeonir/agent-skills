# Brand register

When design IS the product: brand sites, landing and campaign pages, marketing surfaces, portfolios, long-form content, about pages. The deliverable is the design itself — a visitor's impression is the thing being made.

## When to Use

Read by `direction.md` to bias a mood toward this register, and by `design.md` to bias token choices when authoring DESIGN.md. Name the register first, then read the matching file: brand here, or [product.md](product.md) when design serves a task — or both, when the project's surfaces span the two registers (a storefront's marketing shell is brand, its checkout product). Not a direct trigger.

The register spans every genre — a tech brand, a luxury brand, a consumer product, a studio portfolio. They share the stance — *communicate, not transact* — and diverge wildly in aesthetic. Don't collapse them into one look.

## Posture

| | Brand |
|---|---|
| Question | "Would someone say AI made this?" |
| Bar | Distinctiveness — a clear point of view |
| Failure | Safe, average, undifferentiated |
| Permission | Ambitious motion, committed color, distinctive type, art direction per section |

Restraint without purpose reads as generic, not refined. A move that is voice on a brand surface (a drenched hero, an orchestrated page-load) would be noise on a product surface — author tokens for this register, not the other.

## The brand slop test

If someone could look at it and say "AI made that" without hesitation, the identity failed. The bar is distinctiveness; a visitor should ask "how was this made?", not "which AI made this?". Before committing, name the aesthetic lane (the reference) — then describe what you're about to build the way a competitor would describe theirs. If that sentence fits the modal page in the category, restart.

## Token permissions

What brand can author that product can't:

- **Color** — Committed, Full palette, and Drenched are all on the table. A single saturated color across a hero is voice, not excess. Unnamed ambition collapses into beige; name a real reference before picking a strategy.
- **Typography** — a characterful display paired with a refined body; real weight and size contrast (display ≥3× body); fluid `clamp()` headings. Reflex defaults (Inter, Roboto, system) are a tell on a brand surface. Typical roles: `display`, `title`, `subtitle`, `tagline`, `lead`, `eyebrow` — expressive voice — on top of the shared core `body` / `small` / `caption` / `code` / `label` / `button`. The pool is open, not exclusive: any role a surface needs is available (a brand form uses `label`), a functional variant is a suffixed entry (`-emphasis` / `-muted`), and a role that renders at several sizes may carry the size in its key (`display-sm`), additive to the vocabulary.
- **Motion** — one well-orchestrated page-load or signature transition, when the brand invites it.
- **Depth & shape** — expressive elevation and corner language as part of the voice.

## Brand bans (on top of the shared [anti-patterns.md](anti-patterns.md))

- Timid palettes and average layouts — safe is invisible.
- Reflex-default fonts picked for safety, not voice.
- Defaulting to editorial-magazine aesthetics on briefs that aren't magazine-shaped.
- Monospace as lazy shorthand for "technical" when the brand isn't.
- Serif reached for as a sophistication signal — the "creative", "premium", or "editorial" reflex — when the brand's voice doesn't call for it.

## Register is not surface

**Register** (brand vs product) is the posture — two values. **Surface** is the granular type the work actually is (landing, campaign, portfolio, about, the marketing shell of a storefront…). A surface sits under a register, but the register is not a finer surface list. Surfaces under this register:

**Brand surfaces** — landing, campaign, portfolio, long-form / editorial, about, the marketing shell of a storefront. Storefronts straddle: the marketing / catalog shell is Brand, the checkout / account flow is Product (see [product.md](product.md)).
