# Discuss Feature

Resolve gray areas and ambiguities through structured conversation with the user.

## When to Use

- Spec has open questions that block planning or implementation
- Scope is **Complex** and specify detected ambiguous gray areas
- User explicitly asks to discuss a feature's requirements
- Requirements can be interpreted multiple ways

## Output

Creates `.artifacts/features/{ID}-{name}/decisions.md` with user
decisions on gray areas. Use the template at the bottom of this
reference.

## Workflow

> Before writing artifacts, ensure `.artifacts` is excluded locally: `grep -qxF '.artifacts' .git/info/exclude 2>/dev/null || echo '.artifacts' >> .git/info/exclude`

### Step 1: Resolve Feature

1. If ID provided -> use `.artifacts/features/{ID}-{name}/`
2. If no ID -> match current git branch to `branch:` in spec.md frontmatter
3. If no match -> list available features and ask user

### Step 2: Load Spec

Read `.artifacts/features/{ID}-{name}/spec.md`.

Extract:
- Open Questions section
- Any TBD markers in requirements or acceptance criteria
- Edge cases without clear resolution
- Contradictory or ambiguous requirements

If no gray areas found:
- Inform user the spec has no unresolved ambiguities
- Suggest proceeding to the next phase
- Exit

### Step 3: Categorize Gray Areas

Group ambiguities by type:

| Category | Signal | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Behavior | "It depends", multiple interpretations | "Should expired links show an error or redirect?" |
| Scope | Boundary unclear | "Does 'user management' include role-based access?" |
| Priority | Trade-off without preference | "Performance vs simplicity for caching strategy?" |
| Domain | Missing domain knowledge | "What happens when a subscription lapses mid-billing?" |
| Constraint | Unstated limits | "Is there a max number of items per cart?" |

### Step 4: Structured Discussion

For each gray area, present to user:

```
Gray Area: {description}
Context: {why this matters for the feature}

Options:
(a) {option 1} -- {trade-off}
(b) {option 2} -- {trade-off}
(c) {option 3, if applicable} -- {trade-off}
```

**Discussion principles:**

- Present concrete options, not open-ended questions
- Explain trade-offs for each option (what you gain, what you lose)
- If the user doesn't know, suggest the safest default and mark as "tentative decision -- revisit if needed"
- Group related gray areas together -- resolving one may resolve others
- Don't overwhelm -- discuss 2-3 gray areas at a time, then check if user wants to continue

### Step 5: Record Decisions

For each resolved gray area, record:

- The question / ambiguity
- The decision made
- The rationale (why this option)
- Any caveats or conditions

### Step 6: Generate decisions.md

Use the template (below). Create
`.artifacts/features/{ID}-{name}/decisions.md` with all decisions.

### Step 7: Update spec.md

- Remove resolved items from Open Questions
- Update TBD markers with decisions where applicable
- Add reference to decisions.md in Notes section

### Step 8: Report

Inform user:
- Resolved: {count} gray areas
- Remaining: {count} open questions (if any)
- Created: `decisions.md`
- Next step based on scope:
  - **Large/Complex**: Run `design`
  - **Medium**: Run `implement`

## Guidelines

**DO:**
- Always ask the user to resolve ambiguities -- never decide on their behalf
- Present options with trade-offs, not just yes/no questions
- Mark complex gray areas as "needs research" and defer to design phase
- Group related decisions into logical clusters
- Accept tentative decisions -- mark them clearly for future revisit

**DON'T:**
- Resolve ambiguities on behalf of the user
- Ask 15 questions one by one -- group related decisions
- Present options without trade-off analysis

## Decisions Template

ALWAYS use this exact template structure:

````markdown
---
name: {{name}}
created: {{YYYY-MM-DD}}
updated: {{YYYY-MM-DD}}
status: draft
sources: []
id: {{NNN}}
feature: {{name}}
---

# Decisions: {{Feature}}

Decisions on gray areas and ambiguities resolved during discussion.

## Resolved

### {{Gray Area Title}}

- **Question:** {{the ambiguity or question}}
- **Decision:** {{what was decided}}
- **Rationale:** {{why this option was chosen}}
- **Caveats:** {{conditions or things to revisit, if any}}

## Tentative

Decisions marked as tentative — revisit if assumptions change.

### {{Gray Area Title}}

- **Question:** {{the ambiguity}}
- **Tentative Decision:** {{safest default chosen}}
- **Revisit when:** {{condition that should trigger re-evaluation}}
````

## Error Handling

- Spec not found: Suggest `specify`
- No gray areas: Inform user spec is clear, suggest next phase
- User unsure on all options: Suggest safest defaults, mark all as tentative
