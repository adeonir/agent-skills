# Code Correctness Analysis

Deep analysis of generated code for semantic correctness, logic errors, and
issues that tooling cannot catch. Runs as part of verify after every task or
range.

> **LOADED BY:** [verify.md](verify.md) -- not triggered directly

## When to Use

- When verify.md runs (after every task or range)
- Focuses on what LLM code reading catches that linters, type checkers,
  and test suites cannot: semantic correctness, logic errors, architectural
  issues

## When to Skip

- Quick mode (verify itself is skipped)
- Task only changed configuration, documentation, or static assets

## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Project Tooling

Scan the project root for linter, type checker, and static analysis configs.
Read active rules and plugins to determine what is already covered.

| What to Find | Where to Check |
|--------------|----------------|
| Language/runtime | Manifest: package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Cargo.toml, Gemfile, composer.json, *.csproj |
| Linter + active rules | Config files in project root -- read plugins/rules to determine coverage |
| Type checker + strictness | Language-specific config (strict mode, strict null checks, etc.) |
| Security scanner | Dedicated tools or linter plugins with security rules |
| Accessibility checker | Linter plugins with a11y rules |
| Test framework | Scripts or configs in manifest |
| Project conventions | .agents/codebase/ (if exists) |

Build a **tooling coverage map**: for each category below, note whether
active tooling already covers it (fully, partially, or not at all).

If `.agents/codebase/` exists, read project patterns (error handling
conventions, data fetching approach, auth strategy, etc.) to better
calibrate which categories are most relevant and what the project
already handles by convention.

### Step 2: Select Relevant Categories

From the 24 categories below, select ONLY those that:

1. **Apply to the project's technology** -- no framework-specific checks for
   projects that don't use that framework
2. **Relate to code changed in the current task** -- skip database categories
   if no data layer code changed
3. **Are NOT covered by active tooling** -- skip TOOLING-ASSISTED categories
   when the relevant tooling is detected in Step 1

Target: 5-10 categories per analysis. Never run all 24 on a single pass.

### Step 3: Analyze Selected Categories

Read the changed files and analyze against each selected category.

Report only findings with >= 80% confidence. Flag uncertain findings
explicitly with "(uncertain)" in the description.

#### Tier 1 -- High Confidence

Categories where LLM code reading produces reliable results.

| # | Category | Detects | Tooling-Assisted |
|---|----------|---------|------------------|
| 1 | Missing error handling | Async without try/catch, unhandled promise rejections, empty catch blocks, unchecked error returns | No |
| 2 | Unhandled edge cases | Null/undefined not checked, empty collections not handled, division by zero, missing default branches | No |
| 3 | Race conditions | Shared state without synchronization, stale closures over mutable state, concurrent writes to same resource | No |
| 4 | Memory leaks | Event listeners not removed, subscriptions without cleanup, intervals/timers without clear, growing caches without eviction | No |
| 5 | Framework-specific violations | Hook rules (conditional calls, wrong deps), lifecycle misuse, directive errors, middleware ordering | Yes: skip if framework linter plugin active |
| 6 | Dead code paths | Unreachable code after return/throw, branches that never execute, logic shadowed by early returns | Partial: skip trivial cases if linter has unreachable-code rules |
| 7 | Type safety gaps | Any/unknown types, unsafe type assertions, missing type narrowing before access, implicit any | Yes: skip if type checker runs in strict mode |
| 8 | Inconsistent state | State updates that can leave UI/data in invalid state, partial updates without atomicity, derived state out of sync | No |
| 9 | API contract mismatch | Response handling that ignores optional fields, wrong HTTP status codes, request body missing required fields | No |
| 10 | Security vulnerabilities | XSS via unsanitized output, SQL/command injection, insecure randomness for security, hardcoded secrets, path traversal | Partial: skip if security linter/scanner active |

#### Tier 2 -- Medium Confidence

Categories requiring deeper reasoning about data and control flow.

| # | Category | Detects | Tooling-Assisted |
|---|----------|---------|------------------|
| 11 | Boundary conditions | Off-by-one errors, integer overflow, string truncation, timezone/DST edge cases, locale-dependent comparisons | No |
| 12 | Resource exhaustion | Unbounded loops, queries without pagination or limit, caches growing without eviction, file handles not closed | No |
| 13 | Concurrency issues | Double-submit without debounce, optimistic updates without rollback, stale reads after write, lost updates | No |
| 14 | Error propagation | Errors swallowed silently (catch without rethrow/log), missing error boundaries, fallback logic that hides failures | No |
| 15 | Data integrity | Partial writes without transaction, cascade operations not considered, orphan records after delete, constraint violations | No |
| 16 | Auth/authz gaps | Routes or operations without auth check, privilege escalation paths, insecure token storage or transmission | No |
| 17 | Input validation | User inputs without sanitization, missing length/range limits, format validation absent at system boundary | Partial: skip if schema validation lib covers all inputs |
| 18 | Dependency misuse | Deprecated API usage, incorrect lib arguments, missing required configuration, version-incompatible patterns | No |

#### Tier 3 -- Contextual Detection

Categories that depend on knowing the project and domain.

| # | Category | Detects | Tooling-Assisted |
|---|----------|---------|------------------|
| 19 | Performance anti-patterns | N+1 queries, unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization where expensive, large bundle imports for small usage | Partial: skip if perf-focused linter rules active |
| 20 | Accessibility gaps | Missing aria labels, keyboard navigation absent, focus management issues, semantic HTML misuse | Partial: skip if a11y linter plugin active |
| 21 | Internationalization | Hardcoded user-facing strings, locale-dependent date/number formatting, RTL layout not considered | No |
| 22 | Observability gaps | Critical operations without logging, error logs missing context (IDs, params), silent failures in background jobs | No |
| 23 | Configuration drift | Hardcoded values that should be env vars, magic numbers without explanation, environment-specific logic in shared code | No |
| 24 | Backward compatibility | Breaking changes in public APIs, schema migrations without fallback, removed fields still referenced by consumers | No |

### Step 4: Report Findings

Use the same format as verify.md findings with an added Category column:

| Finding | Severity | Category | Description |
|---------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Example | high | Race conditions | `fetchUser` and `updateUser` can run concurrently, causing stale data overwrite |

Severity levels:
- **critical**: Breaks core functionality, data loss, security breach
- **high**: Incorrect behavior under normal conditions, must fix before proceeding
- **medium**: Incorrect behavior under edge conditions, fix recommended
- **low**: Potential issue, note for awareness

Findings merge into verify.md's outcome determination (Step 7).

## Guidelines

**DO:**
- Detect tooling coverage BEFORE selecting categories
- Skip TOOLING-ASSISTED categories when relevant tooling is active
- Select only categories relevant to the code changed in this task
- Use >= 80% confidence threshold for reporting findings
- Merge findings into verify.md's outcome determination
- Include concrete code references (file, line, function) in findings

**DON'T:**
- Run all 24 categories on every analysis
- Report issues that linters or type checkers already catch
- Check framework-specific categories in projects that don't use that framework
- Flag style or formatting issues (that is tooling territory)
- Assume tooling is absent -- always check config files first
- Report findings below 80% confidence without flagging as uncertain
- Duplicate findings already reported by verify.md's other steps

## Error Handling

- No manifest found: assume minimal tooling, run more categories
- Cannot determine language/stack: ask user what stack is in use
- All categories covered by tooling: report "All code correctness categories
  covered by project tooling" and skip analysis
- Uncertain finding: flag as "(uncertain)" in description, never mark as
  critical or high severity
- .agents/codebase/ missing: rely on config file scan only
- Changed files not identifiable: ask user which files to analyze
